# Starting Assignment 3

After a week full of assignments from other courses, finally starting the implementation of Assignment 3. Based on looking at the Assignment last week, I had installed Jupyter Notebook. Now that Q1 of Assignment 3 is started, keep an eye out for me and my progress over the next couple of days!

Going to look at the "00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb" and understand the code structure of the same.
