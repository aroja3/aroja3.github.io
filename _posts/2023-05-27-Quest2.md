# Finished Question 2

After a rough week due to sickness, we're back on track and Question 2 is done. It was seen to achieve an error rate of only approximately 2% after scraping about 200 images of each of the 10 animals respectively.

This is a massive achievement in mahcine learning such that this capability of image recognition is able to be easily comptued using FastAI techonology. 

It is so amazing to see the excellent performance of image recognition with minimal code and computational resources, able to train the image dataset and compare to validation set. 

I truly believe this is the highlight of FastAi and the advancements in Machine learning today!

As seen belive, by Epoch 3, the error rate was aprox. 2.8% (i.e. 97.2% accurate). Considering the minimal code this required, I am still mind blown as to how complex decisions (which once was taught to be impossible) is not possible within our own hands usign FastAI.

The Confusion matrix below shows most of the values on the diagonal thus representing true positive values. This suggests that the algorithm had accurately identified the unknown image. However, there were some False Positives such that for Elephant, Giraffe, , Hippopotamus, and Llama, the wrong picutre was identified as the same. The other animals had no other FPs. In terms of False Negatives, the animals that suggested a False Negative are Giraffe, Kangaroo, Llama, and Rhinoceros, hence predicting that they they weren't the sugegsted animals but another. All other animals had no other FNs.

The top 12 losses were also plotted to understand the images that the system model had challenges identifying the animal.

it can be observed to an extent as to why the Llama and Giraffe (with the image being from a distance) could be a confusion for the system, hence the first image had the highest loss at 4.30. This confirms the False Positives and Negatives as seen in the confusion matrix.

FastAI is awesome!
