# Finished Question 2

After a rough week due to sickness, we're back on track and Question 2 is done. It was seen to achieve an error rate of only approximately 2% after scraping about 200 images of each of the 10 animals respectively.

This is a massive achievement in mahcine learning such that this capability of image recognition is able to be easily comptued using FastAI techonology. 

It is so amazing to see the excellent performance of image recognition with minimal code and computational resources, able to train the image dataset and compare to validation set. 

I truly believe this is the highlight of FastAi and the advancements in Machine learning today!
